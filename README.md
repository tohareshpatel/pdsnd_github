### Approach
###### Question 1 #####
##**What is the most common month?**##
Summary of Question 1 Results: ########

June has the most number of trips.

Data only has trips conducted in 2017 upto July. July data is incomplete, only first week has complete data with only 3 data points in second week. July data be ignored for practical purposes as there only a few data points

###### Question 2 #####
##**How does the average travel time compare across the cities? **##
Summary of Question 2 Results: ########

While the largest peak of travel time count is in NY, Washington has the largest median travel time and therefore the longest travel time on an average

there are many outliers with large values, which is driving the mean higher. Some of these could be valid as people living far wont commute as often. However some of the vlues, for example: the max values of 23.95 hours for Chicago, 598.83 hrs for NY, 343.23 hrs are probably data errors.

###### Question 3 #####
###**Which age/gender combination travels on an average the longest? (only for NYC and Chicago)**##

Summary of Question 3 Results: ########
